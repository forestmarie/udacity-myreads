## Description 

This is a small learning app built to learn React; it is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
